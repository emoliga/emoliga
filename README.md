# Hi everyone, I'm Eva :)

<p>I'm an industrial design and product development engineering student at Universidad de Zaragoza (Spain). However, I'm currently looking forward to learn more about computer science in my spare time and I know this platform and community can be a great help for my journey and for sharing my projects ðŸ«¶. In fact, I'm starting an AI related project with machine learning and developing an agent so I might need support.</p>
